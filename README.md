==================================================================

This project biblically and astronomically pinpoints the year of Jesus Christ’s crucifixion to the Full Mooned Wednesday Passover in 34 AD (0034-03-22)

Search Conditions
-----------------------

1. Wednesday, because [the Crucifixion Was on a Wednesday](https://github.com/TraxData313/crucifixion-date-determination/blob/main/why_crucifiction_was_on_wednesday.md)

2. 14 days from the New moon between 8 March – 5 April:
    - Crucifixion was on a **Passover** (John 19:14)
    - The Passover is commanded to occur on **the 14th day of the first month at even** (Leviticus 23:5)
    - The first biblical month (Nisan/Abib) is lunar and begins with the **new moon** (Exodus 12:2, Psalm 81:3).
    - Nisan occured just before the Exodus from Egypt, **when "And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled."** (Exodus 9:31)
    - the barley is in the ear, and the flax is bolled" near Jerusalem **between 08.March – 05.April** ([relevant study proving that](https://jbqnew.jewishbible.org/jbq-past-issues/2017/453/modern-searches-aviv-barley-context-hebrew-calendar/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

3. **If no new moon** appears in that range, count **14 days from the next new moon** (i.e. intercalated month)
    - If barley was not ripe, a 13th month (Adar II) was added. This was required to align the Passover with the firstfruits harvest (Leviticus 23:10-14).

4. AD 26–36
    - Jesus was crucified during **Pontius Pilate** (Matthew 27:2, Mark 15:15 and many others)
    - Pontius Pilate was Roman governor of Judea **from AD 26 to 36** ([Pontius Pilate Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontius_Pilate#:~:text=Pontius%20Pilate%20%28Latin%3A%20Pontius%20Pilatus%2Cand%20ultimately%20ordered%20his%20crucifixion.))

Further Confirmations
------------------------
- Passover in 34 AD on a Wednesday is also confirmed by these historical-astronomical data from peer-reviewed research [The date of Nisan 14 in Jerusalem AD 26–36](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-date-of-Nisan-14-in-Jerusalem-AD-26-36_tbl1_265114769), even though they were looking for a Friday
- The simpler, but less accurate script cru_years_astr_full_moon.py also confirms the Full Moon was on a Wednesday in 34 AD, and the Passover is on a Full Moon (Full Moon is ~14 days from the New Moon), further confirming that the Moon was fully lid that day


Conclusion
-------------
Given the search criteria, it looks reasonable to say that **Jesus Christ was most likely crucified on the Wednesday Passover in AD 34**.
