# Why the Crucifixion Was on Wednesday

## 🌅 THE PROBLEM: "Three Days and Three Nights"

### 🔑 KEY VERSE:  
**Matthew 12:40**  
> "For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth."

**Simple explanation:**  
Jesus said He would be dead and buried for **three full days and three full nights**, just like Jonah was inside the fish.

➡️ This is **not** just “parts of three days” (like Friday evening to Sunday morning = 1½ days).  
➡️ It must be a **literal** 72-hour period.

## 💡 THE WEDNESDAY SOLUTION

Let’s count **backwards** from Sunday morning:

1. **Sunday morning:** Jesus rises **just before dawn**  
2. So:
   - Saturday night = **night 3**
   - Saturday day = **day 3**
   - Friday night = **night 2**
   - Friday day = **day 2**
   - Thursday night = **night 1**
   - Thursday day = **day 1**

🧠 Which means:  
**Jesus must have been buried just before sunset on Wednesday!**

## ⏳ POINT 1: Jesus Died *Before* a Sabbath… But Not the Weekly One!

### 🔑 KEY VERSE:  
**John 19:31**  
> "The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken..."

**Simple explanation:**  
This wasn’t the regular weekly Sabbath (Saturday). This was a **"high day"** – a **special Sabbath** during Passover week.

> 📘 Leviticus 23:5-7  
> "In the fourteenth day of the first month... is the Lord’s passover... And on the fifteenth day... is the feast of unleavened bread... **ye shall do no servile work**..."

➡️ The 15th of Nisan is always a **holy Sabbath**, no matter what day of the week it falls on.

**So:** Jesus died on **14th Nisan**, and **15th Nisan was a High Sabbath**, starting Wednesday night.

## 🕰️ POINT 2: The Women Waited for the Sabbaths to Pass

Let’s put the timeline together:

1. Jesus is crucified and buried **before sunset on Wednesday** (Luke 23:54).
2. Thursday (15 Nisan) is a **High Sabbath** – nobody can work (John 19:31).
3. Friday – the women buy spices and prepare them (Mark 16:1 and Luke 23:56).
4. Saturday – the **regular weekly Sabbath** – they rest again (Luke 23:56).
5. Sunday – they come to the tomb early and find it **already empty** (Mark 16:2).

### 🔑 KEY VERSES:  

- **Mark 16:1**  
  > "And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene... had bought sweet spices..."

- **Luke 23:56**  
  > "...they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and **rested the sabbath day** according to the commandment."

**Simple explanation:**  
There were **two Sabbaths** that week:  
1. **High Sabbath** (Thursday)  
2. **Weekly Sabbath** (Saturday)

➡️ The women couldn't buy spices on Thursday, so they bought them on Friday, then rested again on Saturday.

## ✝️ POINT 3: Jesus ROSE *after* the 3 full days – Not before!

### 🔑 KEY VERSE:  
**Matthew 28:1-6**  
> "In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week... the angel... said... He is not here: for he is risen..."

**Simple explanation:**  
Jesus already rose **before** the women came at dawn.  
So He must have risen **sometime during the night**, **just after 72 hours ended** from Wednesday evening.

## 🔁 SIMPLE TIMELINE:

| Day         | What Happened                            | Bible Evidence |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Wed (14 Nisan)** | Jesus dies ~3PM, buried before sunset | Luke 23:54 |
| **Thurs (15 Nisan)** | High Sabbath (Feast Day) | John 19:31 |
| **Friday** | Women buy and prepare spices | Mark 16:1 |
| **Saturday** | Weekly Sabbath – women rest again | Luke 23:56 |
| **Sunday early AM** | Tomb is empty – Jesus already risen | Matthew 28:1-6 |

➡️ **Three days and three nights = Wednesday sunset to Saturday sunset**

---

## 🧱 BONUS SUPPORT: Emmaus Road Story

### 🔑 KEY VERSE:  
**Luke 24:21**  
> "And beside all this, **to day is the third day since these things were done**."

This was spoken **on Sunday**.

➡️ Sunday is the **third day since** the crucifixion (which happened Wednesday).

---

## 🔚 CONCLUSION:

- Jesus said: **3 days & 3 nights in the grave**.
- If He died on Friday, that’s **only 1 day and 2 nights**. ❌
- If He died on **Wednesday**, and rose before dawn on **Sunday**, that’s **exactly 72 hours**. ✅
- There were **two Sabbaths**: a special feast day (Thursday) and the weekly one (Saturday).
- All the Bible verses fit like puzzle pieces.
